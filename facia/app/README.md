Fronts - Notes from editor meets
================================

 * Alex Needham
 * Jonathan Haynes
 * Rebecca Allison

Stephan, Francis, Kat and Darren met with the network front editors to discuss their workflow/admin tool usage/general
opinions on fronts. These are some (haphazard) notes on what was discussed

 * Only one editor should be updating a list at any one time
 * Current admin tool makes it cumbersome to move a trail from one trailblock to another (i.e. delete trail from
 trialblock, add to another. Though this process generally involves a furniture (title, standfirst) change anyway)
 * Painstaking to select image with correct dimension on certain trailblocks
 * Would be useful to undo an update, say, go back two steps - further, being able to see a history of changes to the
 fronts
 * Would like to see comments pulled in on front
 * Article metadata (title/standfirst/image) oftens needs to be overridden based on position/tone. Changing in
 composer would slow the workflow down
 * A WYSIWYG would be their preferred tool - the ability to move trails around an actual desktop view - rather than
 working with purely a list
 * Ability to create 'draft' fronts, e.g. when a know event is coming up
 * Preview of changes made to funriture, but not necessarily a preview of trail placement
 * Nice to know how long an article has been on the front - regularly hand over to other editors, not always obvious
 what's old/new content
 * Different editions will also need different furniture
